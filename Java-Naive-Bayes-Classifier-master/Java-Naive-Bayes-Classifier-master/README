Naive Bayes Classifier implemented in Java.

Nothing special, but it works.

Performance improvements, I am currently thinking of:

- Store the natural logarithms of the feature probabilities and add them together instead of multiplying the probability numbers

The classifier will forget classifications after - defaulting to 200 - classifications learned.
This will ensure, that the classifier can react to ongoing changes in the user's habbits.
